Your response goes here!

The new skills that I have learned throughout the first lesson have been very valuable. I would say the importance of indentation has been set into my mind as I have a further understanding of its importance.

What I have found easy was the html tags introduced into this first lesson, I say this because I have had previous moments in which I have written some basic html code before.

What I would say is difficult is getting a solid understanding of paths. Although the examples given in the lesson were great. I feel that later on they can get a bit more complicated and for that reason I am keeping very close attention to that.

Throughout these first couple lessons, I have been using the mozilla site provided while also googling on my own and seeing examples of the tags and paths that other people online have to show.
